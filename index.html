<h2>Mocha's Puppy Adventures</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A simple puppy platformer that is easy enough for most people to succeed in.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to experience joy as they play as the puppy running around in the backyard, collecting treats, but I also want the player to stress at least a little bit with the added game mechanic of the timer, which restricts play time.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This is a platforming game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can move using the directional arrow keys. The player must jump on top of platforms using the up arrow key and collect treats by running into them (by overlapping them). Input is disabled after the time limit is up, and the timer right now is set for 30 seconds, which I feel to be a decent amount of time for how small the map is. For now, there currently is no end game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This game prototype is to test timer functionality and scoring, as well as seeing how well music I write gets ported to the game audio.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Jumping</li>
        <li>Timed activity</li>
        <li>Score system</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The playable character is a puppy named Mocha, who has a jumping ability that defies physics, as well as an oddly shaped backyard to play in. The treats falling from the sky are Mocha's only source of nutrition and sustenance and therefore she must eat them to survive.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You play as a puppy named Mocha, who is lost in the large, never-ending backyard. Scattered throughout the backyard, there are treats left out by Mocha's owner(s), so in order to survive in the backyard until her owners come home to play with her, Mocha must eat as many treats as she can.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Like the previous assignment, this is targeted towards dog lovers, or any fan of platforming games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The timer for the game is currently set to 30 seconds, which is the allotted playtime.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The players that are able to understand how to jump in a video game should have the most success in a platforming game.
</li>
